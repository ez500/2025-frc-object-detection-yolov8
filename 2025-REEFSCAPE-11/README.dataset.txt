The 2025 REEFSCAPE Dataset is specifically curated for training and evaluating computer vision models in the 2025 REEFSCAPE season of the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). This dataset enables autonomous robot systems to accurately identify and interact with key game pieces: CORAL and ALGAE.

* Images feature CORAL and ALGAE in different positions, interactions with robots, and partial occlusions.

This dataset empowers teams to build robust vision systems capable of identifying and manipulating these uniquely designed game pieces, enhancing their performance in the REEFSCAPE challenge.
